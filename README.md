# Deflections-and-Kalman-Filter-1
Deflection measurement with Linear Displacement Sensor, Strain Gage and Kalman Filter on a Beam. 

A Beam that has installed a Strain Gage will be used to compute its Deflection as a Bending Force is applied. A Linear Displacement Sensor will also be used and its measurements will be refined using the Kalman Filter.
